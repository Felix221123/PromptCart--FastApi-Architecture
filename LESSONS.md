# Here are some of lessons/problems/solutions I leant in this project
   - Open AI doesn't currently provide a model for processing images and getting embeddings, you need to use the traditional root of transformers from hugging face
   - When using embeddings for searchings, it basically returns results even it you typed just gibberish text in the search box
   - Using your microservice directly in the frontend is direct instead of connecting it to your backend however it comes with tradeoffs depending your project
